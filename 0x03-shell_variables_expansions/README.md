This project explores environment variables, shell initialization files, and expansions in Linux. Learners will gain practical experience in creating and managing environment and local variables, configuring initialization files for custom settings, and using expansions to perform dynamic operations within the shell. By completing these tasks, learners will understand how to customize the shell environment and enhance their scripts with variables and expansions.

Instructions
Start by completing the quiz you see below. Once you complete the quiz, you can see the activity tasks mentioned in these instructions.
Complete the tasks one by one and follow the submission instructions below to submit your solution to the tasks.
How to Submit
Repository and Directory Setup

Ensure you have a GitHub account set up. If you are new to GitHub, use the GitHub website (https://github.com) to create your repository and upload files.
Create a new repository named system_engineering-devops.
Inside this repository, create a directory called 0x03-shell_variables_expansions where all your script files for this project will be stored.
Adding Files for Each Task

Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the 0x03-shell_variables_expansions directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., 0-alias, 1-hello_you).
Submitting Your Project

Once all files are uploaded/created to the GitHub repository, verify that your directory structure and filenames match the requirements.
Using GitHub UI (Preferred Method)

You can easily upload files through GitHub’s web interface by clicking “Add file” > “Upload files” in your project directory.
For learners comfortable with the command line, feel free to use git commands to interact with GitHub.
Auto-Checking Process
At the end of the submission deadline, the auto-checker will review the tasks for correctness and award points. Ensure each script functions as expected and follows the naming conventions.


Important!
All scripts must be exactly two lines long.
Scripts should end with a new line.
All your files must have this as the first line. This will enable the checker to execute your files.
#!/bin/bash
